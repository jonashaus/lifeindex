## About

LifeIndex is a web application made to help people track their habits & weight. It allows you to define customized "habits" and to track your "achievements" of those habits. That information will be nicely visualized for you.


## Technology Stack

I used the following technologies:

- Next.js: As fullstack framework (Next.js = React + Node.js)
- Supabase: As cloud database & authentication provider
- In addition to that, the following libraries were incredibly helpful:
  - TailwindCSS: For simplified styling
  - shadcn/ui: For a uniform user interface
  - react-hook-form: For managing form state
  - zod: For form validations
  - lucide-react: For icons
  - recharts: For charts / visualizations
